# The Monkees

This Project was undertaken for the Code Institute. This is Milestone Project One demonstrating HTML5 and CSS capability.

I decided to create a website for the band, The Monkees. The website provides an overview of the band, their catalogue (audio and video), upcoming event details, and a number of mediums for users to reach out to the band, for example, through social media.

## UX

I designed this website with two users in mind:

1. Fans; and,
2. Event Organisers.

For Fans, I wanted the website to provide important information upfront(i.e. on the homepage) to engage them immediately. I also wanted to use this opportunity to engage them to further explore the website by making use of call to action buttons with contrasting colours, and the use of various multimedia (e.g. audio, video, images, etc.)

For Event Organisers, I wanted the website to showcase the band's work and demonstrate that they are still active by providing a number of upcoming events, latest single, recent news. To expand on this the Music page provides a good amount of the band's catalogue showcasing their variety. Finally, I created a Booking page which enables them to reach out to the band with their proposition, capturing only the relevant details (e.g. name, venue size, contact details, etc.) and providing an additional information textbox to enable any adhoc/event specific detail of note.

## Features

### Features implemented

Collapsable navigation bar on smaller devices with a popdown menu.

### Features to be implemented

I would like the Booking Form to be fully implemented so that when submitted the data is inputted into a back-end system which either stores it in a database or sends out a structured email with the data included.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap (v4.3.1)
- Bootstrap JS (v4.3.1)
- JQuery (v3.3.1)
- Font Awesome (v5.8.1)

## Testing

1. Different Browsers
2. Different Devices
3. All Links
4. Booking Form Validation
5. GitHub Deployment vs Cloud9 Preview.
6. UI Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

Using GitHub Pages I deployed the website from the Master branch. Using the Master branch means that all commit updates will be reflected on the deployed website,

To run this project locally, you will need to install Git on your computer - see [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Following this you can copy and paste this command into your terminal:

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/jyoung90ie/The-Monkees.git
```

Once saved locally you can open the index.html page and navigate through the website. The links and images will all work as the filepaths referenced in the code are all relative and will adjust accordingly to your local computer.
